# Exercises

These are a set of active learning / problem-solving puzzles -- learning-by-doing, rather than learning-by-watching-videos. The challenges are designed to be (somewhat) fun, and also to highly limit the scope of each problem, so that learners can tackle one aspect of HTML/JS at a time.

To work on exercises, you'll need to create your own copy of this repository.

### Step 1: Fork this Repository

Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Choose your preferred method:

#### Option A: Command Line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/metatool-attentional-mediums-sp26.git
cd metatool-attentional-mediums-sp26
```
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

#### Option B: GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click **File** → **Clone Repository**
3. Go to the **GitHub.com** tab
4. Find `metatool-attentional-mediums-sp26` in your repositories list
5. Choose where to save it on your computer
6. Click **Clone**

#### Option C: VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
3. Type "Git: Clone" and press Enter
4. Paste your fork's URL: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/metatool-attentional-mediums-sp26.git`
5. Choose a folder location
6. Click **Open** when prompted

### Step 3: Set Up Your Folder

1. Copy the `people/TEMPLATE` folder and rename it to your GitHub username:
   ```
   people/TEMPLATE  →  people/your-username
   ```
2. Copy exercise files from `exercises/` into `people/your-username/exercises/` and work on them there.
3. Use `people/your-username/work/` for projects.

**Do not** edit files in `exercises/` directly or modify anyone else's folder.

### Step 4: Submit Your Work

When you're ready to submit, commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork back to the main repository. Your PR should **only** add or change files inside `people/your-username/`.
