Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Folder

1. Copy the `people/TEMPLATE` folder and rename it to your GitHub username:
   ```
   people/TEMPLATE  →  people/your-username
   ```
2. Copy exercise files from `exercises/` into `people/your-username/exercises/` and work on them there.

**Do not** edit files in `exercises/` directly or modify anyone else's folder.
