# Exercises

These are a set of active learning / problem-solving puzzles -- learning-by-doing, rather than learning-by-watching-videos. The challenges are designed to be (somewhat) fun, and also to highly limit the scope of each problem, so that learners can tackle one aspect of HTML/JS at a time.

## Working on Exercises

### Step 1: Set Up Your Folder

1. Copy the `people/TEMPLATE` folder and rename it to your GitHub username:
   ```
   people/TEMPLATE  →  people/your-username
   ```
2. Copy exercise files from `exercises/` into `people/your-username/exercises/` and work on them there.
3. Use `people/your-username/work/` for projects.

**Do not** edit files in `exercises/` directly or modify anyone else's folder.

### Step 2: Submit Your Work

When you're ready to submit, commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork back to the main repository. Your PR should **only** add or change files inside `people/your-username/`.
