# People

This folder is where each student keeps their work.

## Setup

1. Copy the `TEMPLATE` folder and rename it to your GitHub username:
   ```
   people/
     TEMPLATE/       <-- copy this
     your-username/  <-- to this
   ```
2. Do your work inside `people/your-username/`. Use the `exercises/` subfolder for course exercises and `work/` for projects.
3. Do **not** modify the `TEMPLATE` folder or anyone else's folder.

## Submitting

When you're ready to submit, open a pull request from your fork. Your PR should **only** add or change files inside `people/your-username/`.
